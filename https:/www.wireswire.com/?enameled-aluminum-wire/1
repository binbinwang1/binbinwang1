The working principle of magnet wire is to use electromagnetic induction to convert magnetism and electricity into each other. It is mainly used in generators, motors and transformers. With the widespread use of the aforementioned devices, magnet wire is widely used as a base material.

The magnet wire originated in the United States. The GE company in the United States made acetate enameled wire in 1902, and then continued to develop new insulating materials, successively made oily enameled wire, acetal enameled wire, polyester enameled wire, etc. Magnet wire has a wider range of applications. In 1939, Japan developed glass enameled wire, and Germany made polyurethane enameled wire in 1940, further expanding the category of single-layer enameled wire. Since then, the Dodge Company of the United States has made composite enameled wires, which have greatly improved the performance of the magnet wire. The earliest magnet wire made in China was the Shanghai Electric Cable Research Institute, which made polyimide enameled wire and polyamideimide enameled wire in 1966. With the continuous expansion of application fields and the upgrading of downstream industry technologies, after years of development, the variety of electromagnetic wires has been continuously enriched. At present, magnet wire is widely used in industrial motors, power equipment, household appliances, automotive motors, power tools, micro motors, instrumentation, communications, aerospace and other fields.
