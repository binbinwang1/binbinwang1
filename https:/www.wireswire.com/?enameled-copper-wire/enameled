According to different conductors, magnet wires can be divided into copper-based magnet wires, aluminum-based magnet wires and alloy magnet wires. Among them, copper-based and aluminum-based magnet wires are the most widely used in the market. Due to the different metal properties of conductor copper and aluminum, copper-based electromagnetic wires of the same specification have smaller resistivity and greater elongation, that is, copper-based electromagnetic wires have more advantages in electrical conductivity and tensile strength, while aluminum-based electromagnetic wires have more advantages. The wire has more advantages in material cost and lightweight, as follows:

First of all, there is a big difference between the market prices of copper and aluminum (according to wind data, the average price of electrolytic copper 1# in each period of the reporting period is more than 3 times the average price of A00 aluminum), which gives aluminum wire a greater advantage in terms of use cost , The application of aluminum-based magnet wire can greatly reduce product cost. For magnet wire manufacturers, aluminum-based magnet wires can greatly reduce the occupation of working capital and reduce financial costs; for motor manufacturers, the capital occupation of aluminum wire motors is relatively reduced. Secondly, with the gradual increase in the lightweight requirements of downstream products such as household appliances, since the proportion of conductor aluminum is about one-third of that of copper, aluminum-based magnet wire has a more competitive advantage in terms of lightweight.

At the same time, aluminum-based magnet wire manufacturers increase the tensile strength by using aluminum alloy conductors, and at the same time reduce the breakage rate of aluminum wires in the production process by improving production processes, optimizing production equipment, etc., and increasing the wire diameter to improve electrical conductivity. performance. In addition, by adding a small part of copper conductors to the aluminum-based magnet wire, the advantages of copper and aluminum conductors are taken into account, so copper-clad aluminum wires are also used in many fields.
